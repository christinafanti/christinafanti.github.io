    <p>2020 was gearing up to be an epic year for music festivals. But now, instead of getting ready to kick off the festival season, we're stuck at home or stocking up on toilet paper. With postponements and cancellations of Coachella, Stagecoach, SXSW, Ultra, and so many more it’s tough to keep up with it all. A full list of concert and festival cancellations and postponements can be found below.</p>
    <p>#FESTFROMHOME is here to provide you with the latest music news relating to COVID-19. As you patiently wait for things to return to normal, stay up to date with all the major music festival updates, announcements, changes, and cancellations. Additionally, check out our live stream events list to get your music fix online since we are all hunkered down avoiding the sickness that is COVID-19. By the way, we really do highly recommend preventing the spread of this virus by laying low for as long as it takes, and it may be longer than we want. Not just to prevent you from getting sick, but to keep others around you from getting sick as well.</p>
    <p>Stay happy, stay healthy, and stay at home (with some awesome tunes, of course).</p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 21.06px;">Panama has shut down travel to and from the country until May 22nd</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Imagine if Fyre Fest unfolded during a global pandemic, because that’s the situation in Colón, Panama at the moment. Upwards of 40 people who attended the Tribal Gathering Music Festival remains stranded more than a month after the festival shuttered due to COVID-19.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">As Vice reports, on March 12th, three days before Tribal Gathering was set to end, the government of Panama issued a state of emergency over the pandemic, effectively shutting down the country. Attendees of Tribal Gathering were initially ordered to remain in quarantine until March 23rd. Eventually, some festival-goers were allowed to leave, as long as they could prove they had travel accommodations. Dozens of others were stranded, however, after Panama implemented nationwide travel restrictions barring travel to and from the country. The travel ban went into effect on March 30th and was recently extended until May 22nd.</p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 14.94px;">NPR - April 24, 2020</h3>
          <div class="newsimg"><img src="card1-2.jpg" alt="Weezer"></div>
          <h3 style="font-size: 21.06px;">Entertainment companies Live Nation and AEG have modified their refund policies for postponed events.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">The coronavirus pandemic has completely shut down the business of concerts and other live events. That leaves ticket holders looking for refunds, but new rules Ticketmaster announced last week stipulate that a show has to be either officially canceled or have new dates announced in order for the purchaser to be eligible for refunds.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">"We fully expect the availability of refunds to continue to climb over the next 4-6 weeks and ultimately expect all our clients will make refunds available," Ticketmaster said in a statement to NPR, adding that it has already returned $400 million to fans so far. But Ticketmaster, along with rival company AEG — announced new refund policies last week, which still require a concert to be canceled or officially rescheduled with new dates to trigger a refund. Those policies don't go into effect until May 1.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Thousands of people across the globe have been diagnosed with coronavirus (COVID-19). As the outbreak continues, organizers of large public gatherings (such as music festivals and concerts) are being forced to assess whether or not to hold their scheduled events as planned.</p><p style="font-size: 18px;">Among the first big events to be canceled was South by Southwest, which was shut down by the Austin government. Then, Pearl Jam became one of the first major bands to postpone a tour of North America. And, this week, Goldenvoice pushed Indio, California’s annual Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival to October.</p>

          <div class="newsimg"><img src="card2-1.jpg" alt="Imagine Music Festival"></div>
          <h3 style="font-size: 21.06px;">Imagine Music Fest can boast of being the longest-running EDM festival in the city – it launched in 2014 – and continued growth means attendance of about 25,000 fans per day.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">Glenn and Maddy Goodhand are making a major move with their Imagine Music Festival. The couple, who promote their events as Iris Presents, announced earlier this month that the electronic-dance music gathering would expand again to its new location of Bouckaert Farm in Chattahoochee Hills (yes, former site of TomorrowWorld).</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">The new location provides them both a long-term deal and 8,000 acres of ground to present the festival – compared to 900 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, the recent location for Imagine, and 10 acres in its original home of the Masquerade Music Park in downtown Atlanta.</p>

          <h3 style="font-size: 14.94px;">Festicket - April 27, 2020</h3>
          <div class="newsimg"><img src="card2-2.jpg" alt="Rock in Rio Lisboa"></div>
          <h3 style="font-size: 21.06px;">Foo Fighters, The National and Liam Gallagher have confirmed they will be performing at the rescheduled Rock in Rio Lisboa in 2021.</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">The trio were set to perform at this year's festival before it unfortunately got postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, their pledge to return next year will undoubtedly go some way to ease festival-goers' disappointment.</p>
          <p style="font-size: 18px;">They will all perform at Rock in Rio Lisboa on 19th June 2021, and fans who had purchased tickets for 21st June 2020 will have their tickets automatically rolled over to 19th June 2021.</p>
